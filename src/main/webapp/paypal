<p dir="ltr">I've always wanted to understand what happens in a State Of Survival battle. <span>Some are just curious, but it's like the grail for others to be able to find the magic formula which is hidden behind </span> üòú.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For six months now I have been trying to unravel Kings' little secrets. But the subject is very complex. It is with the new fighting system that I have made decisive discoveries that have allowed me to understand and reproduce now a complete battle.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The battle mechanics of the game is realy complex. You have no idea how many formulas and parameters usedüòµ. Kings must have had as much trouble making and calibrating a realistic engine as I did finding their formulas. At first I used an Excel file but that was quickly insufficient. So I developed this application to simulate and understand the result of a battle with an accuracy of &gt; 99%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">‚ö†Ô∏èThe simulator only works for states with the <strong>new battle engine</strong> (currently below 285). This simulator is designed for those who have a good understanding of the game and who are looking for a better understanding of the battle mechanics in order to optimise them. It will not answer simple questions (what ratio should I use). If this is not your case, you don't have to do anything here ‚ö†Ô∏è</p>
<p dir="ltr">Please read <a href="https://en.ultimate-guide.ovh/fights/battle-simulator">this guide</a> carefully and make sure that the clibration works correctly.</p>
