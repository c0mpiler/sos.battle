# State Of Survival Battle simulator

Hi survivors !

I've always wanted to understand what happens in a State Of Survival battle. Some are just curious, but it's like the grail for others to be able to find the magic formula which is hidden behind  üòú.

For six months now I have been trying to unravel Kings' little secrets. But the subject is very complex. It is with the new fighting system that I have made decisive discoveries that have allowed me to understand and reproduce now a complete battle.

The battle mechanics of the game is realy complex. You have no idea how many formulas and parameters usedüòµ. Kings must have had as much trouble making and calibrating a realistic engine as I did finding their formulas. At first I used an Excel file but that was quickly insufficient. So I developed an application to simulate and understand the result of a battle with an accuracy of > 99%.

‚ö†Ô∏èThe simulator only works for states with the new battle engine (currently below 409). This guide is writen for those who have avery  good understanding of the game and who are looking for a better understanding of the battle mechanics in order to optimise them. It will not answer simple questions (what ratio should I use). If this is not your case, you don't have to do anything here ‚ö†Ô∏è
